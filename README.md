This is a project that requires creating a 3D Word Logo from scratch using WebGL, based on concepts from Interactive Computer Graphics (8th Ed.) by Angel.
The goal is to transform the 3D Word Logo into an animated TV Ident—an animated logo used for television channel branding. 
Implement a specific animation sequence, build a user interface to control the logo's parameters, and structure the code for clarity and extensibility.
